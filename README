ABOUT

    This repository packages a collection of tools for analyzing and
    assessing the performance of loop scheduling strategies. Here is
    a brief description of each tool that is hereby shipped:

        * WorkloadGen: a synthetic workload generator that is able to
          generate even and uneven workloads based on well-known
          probabilistic density functions.
        
        * SimSched: an event-driven simulator that enables a fast and
          accurate performance evaluation of several loop scheduling
          strategies.
