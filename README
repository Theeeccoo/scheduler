		* generator: a synthetic workload generator.
		
		* searcher: a state-space explorer that enables the upper-bound
		  assessment of loop scheduling strategies.
		
		* simsched: an event-driven simulator that enables a fast and
		  accurate performance evaluation of several loop scheduling
		  strategies.
